        <h2 style="margin-left: 150px;">Analysis</h2>
        <p>Based on the map of the United States provided, we can observe distinct trends in crime distribution across different regions.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Crime Rates in the Northwestern Region:</strong> 
            This indicates that the frequency of criminal activities in the northwestern part of the United States is comparatively lower than in other regions. 
            Possible factors contributing to this may include lower population density, more remote geographical locations, and relatively stable economic conditions. 
            This may also reflect the effectiveness of social safety measures and law enforcement agencies in this area.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Moderate Crime Rates in the Eastern Region: </strong>
            This suggests that the eastern region experiences a moderate level of criminal activity. 
            Complex social, economic, and geographical factors may be at play. For instance, the presence of large cities might lead to a certain level of criminal activity, but at the same time, there may be more law enforcement agencies and resources available for control and prevention.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>High Crime Rates in the Southern Region: </strong>
            This signifies that the southern region experiences a higher frequency of criminal activities compared to other areas. 
            There may be a range of social issues at play, such as economic instability, high unemployment rates, lower educational levels, and social conflicts. 
            This might require more resources and efforts to address the issue of crime.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>California, Texas, and Florida as Major Crime Hubs: </strong>
            This indicates that these three states have the highest concentrations of criminal activities. 
            There could be a variety of complex factors contributing to crime in these states, including population density, urbanization levels, and economic structures.

        <h2>The number of prisoner in the United states from 2001 to 2016</h2>
        <div id="line_chart" style="left: 175px; margin-top: 80px; float: left;">
        </div>
        <p>Based on the left line chart, we can readily observe the fluctuation in the number of criminal records over the past 16 years. Specifically:
            <br>
            <br>
        <strong>Criminal Record in 2001: </strong>It is evident from the chart that the year 2001 saw the lowest number of criminal records in this 16-year period, with approximately 1.17 million cases. 
        This indicates a relatively low incidence of criminal activity compared to other years, potentially reflecting a degree of stability and safety in the societal environment at that time.
            <br>
            <br>
        <strong>Number of Criminal Records in 2009: </strong>Conversely, 2009 exhibits the peak in criminal records over this 16-year span, with around 1.32 million cases. 
        This suggests a noticeable increase in the frequency of criminal activity during that year, potentially influenced by a range of social, economic, or political factors leading to an uptick in crime rates.
